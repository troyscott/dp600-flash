### Card 1
**Q:** How do you design a semantic model using Power BI?
**A:** Designing a semantic model involves:
- Creating relationships between tables
- Defining data types for columns
- Setting up measures and calculated columns using DAX
- Adding hierarchies to dimensions

**Difficulty:** Basic
**Tags:** dp-600, semantic-model, power-bi

---

### Card 2
**Q:** What is the purpose of a measure in Power BI's semantic model?
**A:** A measure:
- Is defined using DAX formulas
- Provides calculations that are context-sensitive
- Supports complex aggregations and analytical functions

**Difficulty:** Basic
**Tags:** dp-600, semantic-model, dax

---

### Card 3
**Q:** What is the `DIVIDE` function in DAX used for?
**A:** The `DIVIDE` function:
- Safely divides two numbers (numerator and denominator)
- Returns an alternate result if division by zero occurs
- Helps prevent errors in calculations

**Difficulty:** Basic
**Tags:** dp-600, dax, math-functions

---

### Card 4
**Q:** How does the `EVEN` function work in DAX?
**A:** The `EVEN` function:
- Rounds a number up to the nearest even integer
- Useful for scenarios requiring even numbers only

**Difficulty:** Basic
**Tags:** dp-600, dax, math-functions

---

### Card 5
**Q:** What does the `MOD` function return in DAX?
**A:** The `MOD` function:
- Returns the remainder after a number is divided by a divisor
- Commonly used for determining divisibility and creating patterns

**Difficulty:** Basic
**Tags:** dp-600, dax, math-functions

---

### Card 6
**Q:** What does the `PI()` function return in DAX?
**A:** The `PI()` function:
- Returns the mathematical constant Pi (Ï€)
- Used for calculations involving circles and trigonometry

**Difficulty:** Basic
**Tags:** dp-600, dax, math-functions

---

### Card 7
**Q:** What is the purpose of a calculated column in Power BI?
**A:** A calculated column:
- Uses DAX formulas to generate values based on existing data
- Adds new columns with dynamic content that recalculates when underlying data changes

**Difficulty:** Basic
**Tags:** dp-600, semantic-model, dax

---

### Card 8
**Q:** What is the difference between `ROUNDDOWN` and `FLOOR` in DAX?
**A:** Differences:
- `ROUNDDOWN`: Rounds a number towards zero to a specified precision.
- `FLOOR`: Rounds a number down (towards zero) to the nearest multiple of significance.

**Difficulty:** Basic
**Tags:** dp-600, dax, math-functions

---

### Card 9
**Q:** What is the purpose of relationships in Power BI's semantic model?
**A:** Relationships:
- Connect tables based on common columns (keys)
- Enable data filtering and aggregation across related tables
- Support complex queries involving multiple entities

**Difficulty:** Basic
**Tags:** dp-600, semantic-model, power-bi

---

### Card 10
**Q:** How is a hierarchy defined in Power BI?
**A:** A hierarchy:
- Organizes data into levels (e.g., Year > Quarter > Month)
- Enables drill-down and roll-up capabilities for analysis
- Can be created from dimension tables with natural key relationships

**Difficulty:** Basic
**Tags:** dp-600, semantic-model, power-bi
