### Card 3
**Q:** What is the purpose of Semantic Modeling in Microsoft Fabric?
**A:** Semantic modeling in Microsoft Fabric serves to:
- Define a business-oriented layer over raw data
- Enhance query performance and scalability
- Provide a consistent and secure way for users to interact with data

**Difficulty:** Basic
**Tags:** dp-600, semantic-modeling, fabric

### Card 4
**Q:** How do you create explicit measures in Power BI?
**A:** To create explicit measures:
1. Open the **Modeling** tab
2. Click on **New Measure**
3. Use DAX formulas to define calculations explicitly

**Difficulty:** Basic
**Tags:** dp-600, power-bi, semantic-modeling

### Card 5
**Q:** What is Row-Level Security (RLS) in Microsoft Fabric?
**A:** RLS in Microsoft Fabric:
- Enables filtering of data based on user roles or groups
- Enhances security by restricting access to sensitive data
- Can be configured via the workspace settings and datasets

**Difficulty:** Intermediate
**Tags:** dp-600, rls, fabric-security

### Card 6
**Q:** How does Lakehouse differ from Warehouse in terms of storage?
**A:** Key differences:
- **Lakehouse**: Utilizes Delta Lake for efficient data management
- **Warehouse**: Typically uses traditional database formats like SQL Server or PostgreSQL

**Difficulty:** Basic
**Tags:** dp-600, lakehouse, warehouse

---

### Card 7
**Q:** What is the role of OneLake in Microsoft Fabric?
**A:** OneLake acts as:
- A central repository for data
- An integrated platform combining features from Lakehouse and Warehouse
- The foundation for semantic modeling and analytics in Fabric

**Difficulty:** Basic
**Tags:** dp-600, onelake, fabric

---

### Card 8
**Q:** What is the purpose of Direct Lake in Power BI?
**A:** Direct Lake allows:
- Real-time data access from Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2
- Efficient querying and analytics without extracting data into local files

**Difficulty:** Basic
**Tags:** dp-600, power-bi, direct-lake

---

### Card 9
**Q:** How does DISTINCTCOUNT work in DAX?
**A:** DISTINCTCOUNT:
- Counts the number of distinct items in a column or table
- Example: `DISTINCTCOUNT(Sales[ProductID])` counts unique product IDs

**Difficulty:** Basic
**Tags:** dp-600, dax, functions

---

### Card 10
**Q:** What is the difference between EXCEPT and DISTINCT?
**A:** Key differences:
- **EXCEPT**: Returns a table that contains rows from one dataset but not another
- **DISTINCT**: Removes duplicate values within a single column or expression

**Difficulty:** Basic
**Tags:** dp-600, dax, functions

---

### Card 11
**Q:** How do you optimize query and report performance in an enterprise-scale semantic model?
**A:** Optimization strategies:
- Use indexed columns for faster querying
- Limit data retrieval to necessary fields
- Implement caching mechanisms where possible

**Difficulty:** Intermediate
**Tags:** dp-600, optimization, semantic-modeling

---

### Card 12
**Q:** What is the role of dynamic RLS in Microsoft Fabric?
**A:** Dynamic Row-Level Security (RLS):
- Adjusts data access based on real-time conditions or user attributes
- Enhances security and compliance by dynamically filtering datasets

**Difficulty:** Intermediate
**Tags:** dp-60 IF NOT PROVIDED: Skip this card as it may not fit the provided context.

### Card 13
**Q:** What is a shared semantic model in Microsoft Fabric?
**A:** A shared semantic model:
- Allows multiple workspaces to use the same data model definition
- Facilitates consistent and centralized management of business logic

**Difficulty:** Basic
**Tags:** dp-600, fabric, semantic-modeling
